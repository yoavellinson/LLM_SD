# ContextDiarist    
## Dialogue boundaries inferred through global context.  

ContextDiarist performs dialogue diarization using an LLM that can interpret long-range relationships, global context, and conversational dynamics. Instead of relying solely on acoustic cues, the system segments and attributes turns by understanding speaker intent, topical flow, semantic continuity, and cross-utterance dependencies. This enables accurate diarization even in cases with overlapping themes, indirect references, or sparse speaker markers, leveraging the LLM’s holistic view of the entire conversation.
